    description: `I'm a curious tinkerer and a passionate software engineer with a deep interest in 
    engineering efficient solutions to complex problems. With a solid foundation in computer science and 
    the software development lifecycle, I build robust, scalable applications following best engineering practices.
    My approach balances current constraints with future scalability, always valuing clear communication and collaboration. 
    <br/>
    Beyond coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, following news, and analyzing personal finance trends. I love cooking, 
    traveling, and trekking in the mountains. In my spare time, you'll find me playing sports, watching live matches, 
    or discussing life's adventures with friends.`
